This repository contains code and data associated to the paper "Rational isolated j-invariants from $X_1(\ell^n)$ and $X_0(\ell^n)$" by Abbey Bourdon and Ã–zlem Ejder.

Our code requires the gl2.m file associated to the paper "l-adic images of Galois for elliptic curves over $\mathbb{Q}$" by Jeremy Rouse, Andrew V. Sutherland, and David Zureick-Brown. This can be found at https://github.com/AndrewVSutherland/ell-adic-galois-images/blob/main/groups/gl2.m.
